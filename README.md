<h1>An ACL project</h1>

<h1>!J.A.L.P</h1>
Not Just Another Learning Platform. 
It is a platform to allow people to learn new topics or further increase their knowledge through online videos made by tutors who register to our website and create courses.

<h1>Motivation</h1>
This was most definitely not just another university project that will get thrown out the window after submission :innocent:.
This is a learning experience and our first step into a bigger scale project where we self-learned the MERN Stack and Agile Methodology to distribute the tasks among us and use github to host our code for easier access between us and version control

<h1>Build Status</h1>
As nearly all websites, this website is still incomplete and has bugs. It is still in it's early stages and missing items such as:



<h1>Code Style</h1>
Model-View-Controller (MVC) was used where items are seperated for easier maintainance where Model contains the schema shape of items stored in database, View for the front-end methods and Controller for the back-end methods.

<h1>Screenshots</h1>
<h1>Tech/Framework used</h1>
MongoDB as our noSQL database 
ExpressJS
ReactJS
NodeJS
JavaScript as language used to develop the frontend and backend
Material-UI to enhance the user interface with styling components like buttons and text fields
